Based on openrocketengine, a program designed by Cameron Flannery

Adapted to increase ease of access for general members and interfacing with other programs.

How to use:

1) Edit settings in test_config.cfg
	File name can be changed if necessary, but requires code changes, so only change
	if you understand how to adapt the file

2) Run interface.py

3) Data will be exported to an excel file based on engine name set in the config file
