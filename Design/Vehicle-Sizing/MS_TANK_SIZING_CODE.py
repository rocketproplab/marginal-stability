''' Beginning of Marginal Stability Tank Sizing Code
    This code will take inputs from a .txt file containing all relevant
    vehicle sizing data and information and compute important estimates
    such as tank height, volume, thickness, and mass.  These values
    provided will only be estimates; however, the code will take into
    account as many variables and parameters as possible to ensure
    the most accurate result.
    Work in Progress

        ''' Quick note here: I'd already written the code such that it would allow for two different
        tank pressure inputs before adding the input text file capability, and I really didn't want
        to go back and rewrite all my code at the risk of missing a variable somewhere or skewing an
        equation.  Leaving it like this also makes it a lot easier down the road if we decide we'd like
        to keep the two tanks at different pressures for some reason.  It also makes it a lot easier to
        tell which tanks you're doing calculations for if they have different variable names, rather than
        just a generic "tank pressure".'''
